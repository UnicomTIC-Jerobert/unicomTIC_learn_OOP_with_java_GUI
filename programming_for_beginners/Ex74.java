/*
 * #74 - Java input output I/0 Streams
- Types of Streams
Depending upon the data a stream holds, it can be
classified into:

- Byte Stream (to read and write a single byte (8 bits) of data)
All byte stream classes are derived from base abstract
classes called InputStream and OutputStream.

- Character Stream (to read and write a single
character of data.)
All the character stream classes are derived from base
abstract classes Reader and Writer.
