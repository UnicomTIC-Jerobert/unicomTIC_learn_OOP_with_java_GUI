Computer Languages
. Low Level Languages
. It is written in binary code or machine code, which
means it basically comprises of only two digits - 1
and 0.
. Assembly Language
It is a development on the machine language, where
instead of using only numbers, we use English words,
names, and symbols.
. High Level Language
. When we talk about high level languages, these are
programming languages. Some prominent examples
are PASCAL, FORTRAN, C++ etc.

What is Java?

路 Java is a popular programming language, created in
1995.
. It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3
billion devices run Java.
. It is used for:
. Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
. Desktop applications
. Web applications
路 Web servers and application servers
路 Games
路 Database connection And much, much more!

History of Java

. James Gosling and Patrick Naughton initiated
the Java language project in June 1991. The small
team of sun engineers called Green Team.
. Initially it was designed for small, embedded
systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.
. Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James
Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
. After that, it was called Oak and was developed as
a part of the Green project.




Iteration 1:

number = 1234
remainder =1234 % 10=4
reverse=0 * 10+4=0+4=4
number = 1234/10=123
Now the value of the number and reverse variable is 123 and 4, respectively.

Iteration 2:

number = 123
remainder= 123% 10=3
reverse= 4 * 10+3 = 40 + 3 = 43
number=123/10=12
Now the value of the number and reverse variable is 12 and 43, respectively.

Iteration 3:

number = 12
remainder = 12 % 10 = 2
reverse= 43 * 10+2= 430 + 2 = 432
number=12/10=1
Now the value of the number and reverse variable is 1 and 432, respectively.

Iteration 4:

number = 1
remainder=1 % 10 = 1
reverse= 432 * 10+1 = 4320 + 1 = 4321
number=1/10=0
Now the variable number become 0. Hence, we get the reverse number 4321 .* /
